# MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

## Introduction  
 Modern web development is all about data and user experience. In this challenge, I refactored the Book Search Engine to use GraphQL and Apollo Server, allowing users to search for books and save their searches. The stack includes a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
